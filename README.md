Olugbenga Pearse Portfolio

User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project 

I designed this portfolio project for any employer or recruiter who is ready to hire me as their company software developer.  This portfolio is designed to cover every aspect about me which include: Education, my coding and computer skills, experience, contact, technologies etc.

UX
This portfolio website is designed specifically for any recruiter or employer who want to see few of my best abilities both physically and psychologically in what I can offer their company if I am eventually employed.

This project is just a tip of the ice-bag of what I can offer your company. If I can offer this as a work in progress web developer student, I can assure you that you are yet to see the best of me because I keep learning and developing myself in this world of ICT global trends.

Goal
My goal is to design a user friendly web portfolio that will make it easy for every recruiter and employer to access by reducing if not totally eradicates the stress of physical interview.

Scope
I have designed this portfolio to give an overview of myself and my competency for any employer or recruiter to epitomise my educational skill, work and experience in all fields that I have delved into.

Structure
I have structured and tailor this design for every employer or recruiter to be able to access my work as quickly as possible. Also, I have given a brief summary of my project with a link to a github for perusal and necessary action. Furthermore, I have my github coupled with download link of my resume are provided in the portfolio for further details.

Features
I have created the menu to be inline in which I separated each heading with a slash for uniqueness. I decided to create two columns in a row of the menu so as to have the social icons on the right side with column four sizes.
The second row was divided between my picture and my name with title under it.
The third row was designed to contain each of the title in the menu as well as other sub feature that may be included.
Finally, the footer row was design to contain my contact address, phone number, email and my resume download link.

Features left to implement
I would love to include more animation and JavaScript to beautify the menu bar, time line and the progress bar in the near future.

Technology
The technologies used in this project are as follow:
Language
i.	HTML
ii.	CSS
iii.	BOOTSTRAP
Libraries and Tools
i.	Codeinstitute.net/tutorial video
ii.	W3school.com
iii.	Css-tricks.com
iv.	Stackoverflow.com
v.	Themes.getbootstrao.com
vi.	Themeforest.net
I used most of these sites when I saw a design of any webpage, uniqueness and I need to have idea of the name of the design and how to implement it.

Testing
This portfolio website project had been tested across some few browsers. to mention but few like Mozilla Firefox, Google chrome etc. it has also been tested on some mobile devises and tablet for its responsiveness and compatibility. 
The only flaw was in the opening of the timeline on the mobile devices in which the arrows beside the main is not accurately aligned.
Secondly, the social icons are not well position under the menu when viewing on a tablet or on bigger mobile devices.
The first and secondly flaws can be rectified if only I am giving enough time to work on my @media queries which I believed that’s where the solution to these problems are.
I created a trage=”_blank” for my CV to be downloadable of a separate page by clicking on the download icon in the footer section for any employer or recruiter that desires a hard copy.
The contact section was design in such a way that when there is a wrong input of email of password in the text, an invalid or error message will return and the whole page will reload automatically by itself.

Deployment
The deployment of this website can be done directly from the master section in the github and this update automatically whenever there is a new adjustment committed.
